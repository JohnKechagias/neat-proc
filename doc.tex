\section*{Abstract}

An experiment was conducted where neural networks are trained throught the use of the 
NEAT algorithm and self-play to learn a deterministic game resembling checkers. In 
greater detail, multilayer feedfoward neural networks were used to evaluate alternative
bord positions and make moves based on the minmax search algorithm.

\section*{Implementation Specification}

\section*{Game Rules}

The game is played on a five by five board (see Fig 1). There are two players, denoted
as "red" and "blue". Each board tile can hold a maximum of ten pieces. We say that a 
player owns a tile when he pieces on it. Players starts on opposite corners of the 
board with one pop each. The blue player moves first and then play alternates between 
sides. There are two kind of moves available to each player named "move" and "reproduction". Firstly, he can select 
any number of his pieces that exist on the same tile and move them to an adjacent one, 
either diagonally or horizontally. Secondly, he can choose any tile that one, has pieces
on and second, the number of pieces is less that the maximum one and add one piece to it.
When a player moves pieces to a tile that contains pieces of the opponent, in other words attacks a tile that is owned
by the opponent, the number of tiles
of
